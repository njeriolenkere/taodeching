        <h1 class="h1"> TAO TE CHING</h1>	
         <div class="headline">
         	<p>Tao Te Ching pronounced as Dao De Jing is a book of wisdom written around 500bc in China by Lao Tzu; Lao Tzu translates as old wise person. Tao is not a religion, it is a Way; a Way of seeing things and a Way of being. Whether you are religious or not, I hope that you enjoy reading the wisdom of Tao. And I hope that Tao brings you peace, healing and all the things that you wish for.

		<h2><a name ="1" ></a> Chapter One</h2>
		<p> 
		<br>Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.</br>
		<br>The name that can be named is not the eternal Name. </br>
	    <br>Tao is both the named and the unnamed. </br>
		<br>Unnamed, is the origin of Heaven and Earth; </br>
		<br>Named is the Mother of all things.</br> 

		<br>Ever desireless, one sees the mystery; </br>

		<br>Ever desiring, one sees the outward manifestations. </br>

		<br>Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source.</br>
	    <br>This source is called the void;  </br>
        <br>Void is the doorway to all understanding.</br>

        </p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="2" ></a> Chapter Two</h2>
		<p>
		<br>As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly. </br>

		<br>As soon as virtue is known as something good, it becomes evil.</br> 

		<br>Therefore being and non-being give birth to each other. </br>

		<br>Difficult and easy accomplish each other. </br>

		<br>Long and short form each other.</br> 

		<br>High and low distinguish each other. </br>

		<br>Sound and tone harmonize each other.</br> 

		<br>Before and after follow each other as a sequence. </br>

		<br>Realizing this, the Master lives openly with the apparent duality and paradoxical unity.</br>

		<br>The Master performs effortlessly according to the natural Way without personal desire and practices the wordless teaching through one’s deeds; </br>

		<br>They inspire the vitality of all lives, without holding back;</br>

		<br>They nurture all beings without possessing them;</br> 

		<br>They devote all their energy but has no intention to hold on to the merit; </br>

		<br>When success is achieved, the work is forgotten; </br>

	    <br>Thats why it lasts forever. </br>	
		</p>


		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2><a name ="3" ></a> Chapter Three </h2>
			<p> 
		<br>By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute. </br>

		<br>By not valuing the hard-to-get objects, people will not become robbers.</br> 

		<br>By not desiring, one’s heart will not be confused. </br>

		<br>Therefore the Master teaches: </br>
		<p class="iPara"> 
	     <br>Empty your mind;</br>
	     <br>Substantiate your virtue; </br>
	     <br>Weaken your worldly ambition;</br>
	     <br>Strengthen your essence. </br></p>

		<p><br>The Master lets the people to be innocent of worldly knowledge and desire, and keeps the clever ones from making trouble with their wits. </br>

		<br>The Master acts naturally without desire, then everything will be accomplished in its natural order.</br>
			</p></p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2><a name ="4" ></a> Chapter Four</h2>
			<p>
		<br>Tao that is empty but inexhaustible.</br> 

		<br>It is bottomless and subtle like an abyss that is the origin of all things. </br>

		<br>It is complete and perfect as a wholeness that can: 

		<p class="iPara">
		<br>Rounds off sharp edges;  </br>
		<br>Resolve confusion; </br> 
		<br>Harmonize with the glory; </br> 
		<br>Act in unity with the lowliness. </p>

		<p><br>Tao is so profound and yet in invisible, It exists in everywhere and anywhere.</br> 

		<br>I do not know whose Child It is, It existed before Heaven and Earth.</br>		

			</p></p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2><a name ="5" ></a> Chapter Five</h2>
			<p>
		<br>Nature nurtures all things with the wholeness of complete virtue. </br>

		<br>It shows the greatest and perfect kindness by giving life to let all things grow and accomplish them with the hastening of harvest.</br> 

		<br> The Master is like Heaven and Earth, to them none are special;</br>

		<br>They do not take sides, they welcome all without judgement; </br>
	    <br> They give unconditionally, offering their treasures to everyone. </br>

		<br>Between Heaven and Earth, there is a space like the bellows;</br>

	   <br> It appears empty yet it gives a supply that never fails; </br>

	   	<br>The more it moves, the more it brings forth. </br>

		<br>The more many words are spoken, the more it leads to exhaustion;</br> 

	    <br>It is better stay centered. </br>

			<h2> <a name ="6"> </a> Chapter Six </h2>
		<p>
		<br>Spirit is Immortal, It is called the Mystic Nature.</br>

		<br>The Gate of the Mystic Nature is regarded as the Root of the Universe.</br>

		<br>Listen to Its voice, hear It echo through creation.</br> 
		<br> Without fail the Mystic Nature reveals Its presence </br>
		<br>Without fail, It brings us to our own perfection. </br>
		<br>Although It is invisible It endures; It will never end. </br>


			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2><a name ="7"></a>Chapter Seven</h2>
			<p>
		<br> Heaven is everlasting and Earth is enduring.</br>
		
        <br>Why do Heaven and Earth last forever? It is because they do not exist for themselves. </br>

		<br>Thus, although the Master puts themself last, finds themself in the lead. </br>

		<br>Although the Master is not self-concerned, finds themself accomplished. </br>

		<br>It is because they are not focused on self-interests and hence can fulfill their true nature. </br>
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2> <a name ="8" ></a>Chapter Eight</h2>
			<p>
		<br>A person of great virtue is like the flowing water. </br>

		<br>Water benefits all things and contends not with them. </br>

		<br>It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao. </br>

		<br>A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to anything. </br>

		<br>Their mind is like the deep water that is calm and peaceful. </br>

		<br>Their heart is kind like water that benefits all. </br>

		<br>Their words are sincere like the constant flow of water. </br>

		<br>Their governing is natural without desire which is like the softness of water that penetrates through hard rocks. </br>

		<br>Their work is of talent like the free flow of water. </br>

		<br>Their movement is of right timing like water that flows smoothly. </br>

		<br>A virtuous person never forces their way, they move in harmony with nature and hence always knowing the truth of just what to do.</br> 
			</p>


		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
			<h2> <a name ="9" ></a>Chapter Nine</h2>
			<p>
		<br>Be overly proud and arrogant of your wealth and fame and you will be like the overflowing water which shall cause damages. It is better to restrain early.</br>

		<br>Be not content with your wealth and fame and it will be like polishing the edge of a knife, the sharper it gets, the easier it is to break. </br>

		<br>Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess enough.</br> 
		
		<br>Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner.  </br>

        <br>The wisdom of Tao teaches one that humbleness, contentment and gratitude, is the path to serenity.</br> 

			</p>



		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2> <a name ="10" ></a>Chapter Ten</h2>
		<p>
		<br>Can one unite the body and the spirit as one and embrace the “Oneness” without departing from the Great Tao? </br>

		<br>Can one achieve harmony with such gentleness by holding on to the true spirit within as if the innocence of an infant? </br>

		<br>Can one free oneself from worldly knowledge and cleanse one’s mind, so that no faults shall be made? </br>

		<br>Can a ruler love the people by governing them with the natural Way without personal intention? </br>

		<br>Can the Mystic Gate to all life essence be opened or closed without the virtue of the Mystic Nature? </br>

		<br>Can one gain the insight of Nature and become a wise person without the effort of action? </br>

		<br>The Mystic Nature creates and nurtures all things without the desire to possess them.</br> 

		<br>It performs all efforts without claiming for credit. </br>

		<br>It flourishes all beings without the intention to control or dominate.</br> 

		<br>Such is the “Mystic Te” or “Mystic Virtue."</br>
		</p>


		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="11" ></a>Chapter Eleven</h2>
		<p>
		<br>Thirty spokes unite around one hub to make a wheel; </br>

		<br>It is the presence of the empty space that gives the function of a vehicle. </br>

		<br>Clay is molded into a vessel;</br>

	    <br>It is the empty space that gives the function of a vessel.</br>

		<br>Doors and windows are carved out to make a room; </br>

		<br>It is the empty space in the room that gives its function. </br>

		<br>Therefore, something substantial can be beneficial; </br>

		<br>While the emptiness of void is what can be utilized.</br>
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="12" ></a>Chapter Twelve</h2>
		<p>
		<br>The five colors can blind one’s eyes.</br> 

		<br>The five tones can deafen one’s ears. </br>

		<br>The five flavors can dull one’s taste buds.</br> 

		<br>Many thoughts can weaken one's mind.</br>

		<br>The pursuit of pleasures and wasting energy on getting the hard-to-get valuables can distort one’s behavior. </br>

		<br>Therefore, the Master observes the world, but trust their inner vision. </br>

		<br> They allow things to come and go.</br>

		<br>Their heart is open as the sky.</br>


		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="13" ></a>Chapter Thirteen</h2>
		<p>
		<br>Honor and disgrace can surprise a person.</br> 

		<br>What does it men by “Honor and disgrace can surprise someone?” </br>

		<br>Honor is inferior, because one who wins the favor is afraid of losing it. And one who loses the favor is frightened with distress. </br>

		<br>The greatest distress lies in one’s physical body. </br>

		<br>What does it mean by “The greatest distress lies in one’s body?” </br>

		<br>We have fear because we worry about our physical self. We think, "i am this body and will soon die." </br>

		<br>If one’s body does not exist, how can one have fear? </br>

		<br>Therefore, those who sees themselves as everything, are the Guardians of the world. </br>

		<br>Those who love the world as much as they loves themself, are the Teachers of the world.</br>
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="14" ></a>Chapter Fourteen</h2>
		<p>
		<br>That which cannot be seen is called the invisible.</br>

		<br>That which cannot be heard is called the inaudible.</br>

		<br>That which cannot be touched is called the intangible. </br>

		<br>These three cannot be examined and comprehended. </br>

		<br>By intuition you can see it, hear it and feel it.</br>

		<br>Then the unseen, the unheard and the untouched are present as one.</br>
		
        <br>Its rising brings no dawn, its setting brings no darkness; it goes on and on unnamable, returning into nothingness.</br>

		<br>Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end. </br>

		<br>You cannot know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life.</br>

		<br>By discovering how things have always been, brings one into harmony with the Way.</br>

		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="15" ></a>Chapter Fifteen</h2>
		<p>
		<br>The ancient Masters were subtle and mysterious. </br>

		<br>Their wisdom was of immeasurable profundity. </br>

		<br>Because they were too subtle to be known, they were described as follow: </br> 
		<p class="iPara"> 
		    <br>Cautious, as if crossing an icy river.</br> 
		    <br>Alert, as if fearful of the surroundings. </br> 
		    <br>Reverent, like an honorable guest.  </br>
		    <br>Yielding, like winter ice began to melt in spring. </br> 
		    <br>Simple and sincere, like a child. </br>
		    <br>Open-minded, like an empty valley.</br>
		    <br>Harmonized, like the turbid water. </p>

		<p><br>How can one turn the turbid water into clarity?</br>

		<br>A person of Tao would maintain peace in order to achieve pureness of the mind.</br> 

		<br>And therefore they shall not be disturbed by the worldly desires. </br>

		<br>After achieving pureness of the mind, how can one let it be everlasting? </br>

		<br>A person of Tao would unify and harmonize themself with all beings which shall lead to eternity. </br>

		<br>Those who abide by this Tao will not indulge themselves in the desire of greed.</br> 

		<br>It is because of this humbleness that enables one to embrace the original “Oneness,” the Great Tao.</br>
		</p></p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="16" ></a>Chapter Sixteen</h2>
		<p>
        <br>Become totally empty, let your heart be at peace and your mind at ease.</br>
		<br>Admidst the rush of worldly comings and goings, observe how endings becomes beginnings.</br>
		<br>Things flourish each by each, only to return to the Source.</br>
		<br>To return to the root is to find peace. </br>
		<br>To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny.</br>
		<br>To fulfill one's destiny is to be constant.</br>
		<br>To know the constant is called insight.</br>
		<br>Not knowing this cycle leads to eternal disaster.</br>
		<br>Knowing this cycle gives on perspective.</br>
		<br>This perspective is impartial.</br>
		<br>Impartiality is the highest nobility; the highest nobility is Divine.</br>
		<br>Being Divine, you will be at one with Tao.</br>
		<br>Being at one with Tao is eternal.</br>
		<br>This way is everlasting, not endangered by physical death.</br>
		</p>

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="17" ></a>Chapter Seveteen</h2>
		<p>
        <br>With the greatest leader, people barely know one exists.</br>
		<br>Next comes one whom they love and praise.</br>
		<br>Next comes one who they fear.</br>
        <br>Next comes the one whom they despise and defy.</br>
		<br>When a leader trusts no one, no one trust them.</br>
		<br>The great leader speaks little and never speaks carelessly.</br>
		<br>They work without self-interest.</br>
		<br>Such people would act effortlessly and in harmony with Tao.</br>
		
		</p>
		

		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="18" ></a>Chapter Eighteen</h2>
		<p>
		<br>When Great Tao is present, action arises from one's heart.</br>
		<br>When Great Tao declines, action arises from the rules.</br>
		<br>If you need rules  to be kind and just, this is a sign that Great Tao is absent. <br>
	    <br>Thus, the great hypocrisy shall arise. </br>

		<br>When the six various family relationships are not in harmony, filial piety and compassion shall arise. </br>

		<br>When a country is in chaos, the loyal officials shall appear.</br>
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapters">
		<h2><a name ="19" ></a>Chapter Nineteen</h2>
		<p>
		<br>Transcend the Master’s teaching and conceal one’s wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the people a hundred fold. </br>

		<br>Extend kindness to its ultimate and then refine one’s righteousness, shall help the people regain filial piety and compassion.</br>

		<br>Extend one’s personal benefit to share with others, shall eliminate robbers and thieves.</br> 

		<br>These three statements are apparent superficial and not sufficient to express the natural “Way” of the Great Tao. </br>

		<br>Hence, this is what people should do:  </br>
              <p class="iPara"> 
		       <br>Return to their original true self and embrace the pure “Oneness.”  </br>

		       <br>Refrain from selfishness and diminish worldly desires.

		<br>How great is the difference between good and evil? </br>

		<br>What people naturally fear, should one also fear? </br>

		<br>What people naturally value, should one also value? </br>

		<br>One’s endless desire can result in negligence of the true nature of life. </br>

		<br>People like to pursue after excitement as if they were ascending the terrace in spring and celebrate a sacrificial feast. </br>

		<br>But I alone remain quiet and calm like an infant who is pure and innocent. </br>

		<br>And I alone appeared to be lost like one who has nowhere to go.</br>

		<br>All people chase fame, while I alone am simple and want to be left alone.</br>

		<br>People seemed bright and shrewd, while I seemed dull. </br>

		<br>People like to dispute, while I alone remain quiet. </br>

		<br>I am calm and peaceful like the boundless ocean. </br>

		<br>I am open-hearted and free like the wind blowing high above the sky without hindrance. </br>

		<br>Thus, the Master acts by offering their surplus to others. </br></p>

		<p><br>What person has more than enough and gives it to the world?</br>

		<br>Only the person of Tao. </br>

        <br>The Master can keep on giving because they have an endless abundance of wealth.</br>

        <br>The Master acts without expectations;</br>

        <br>The Master succeeds without taking credit;</br>

        <br>The Master does not think that they are better or worse than anyone else.</br></p>

		<br>There is nothing in this world that is softer and meeker than water;</br>

		<br>Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it. </br>

		<br>What is soft can overcome the strong;</br> 

		<br>What is gentle can overcome the hard; </br>

		<br>This is known by the world; </br>

		<br>However, few people put it into practice. </br>

		<br>Therefore, the Master said as follow:</br> 
        <p class="iPara"> 
	    <br>The Master remains serene in the midst of sorrow.</br>

		<br>Evil cannot enter the Master's heart.</br></p>

		<br>Because the Master has given up helping, they are people's greatest help. </br>
		<p><br>True words seem paradoxical.</br></p>

		<br>When a great resentment has resulted; </br>

		<br>Even if one tries to reconcile and make peace;</br> 

		<br>There is bound to leave some remaining resentment. </br>

		<br>Thus, how can this be considered as a good settlement? </br>

        <br>Therefore, the Master cultivates themself with introspection and self-discipline without blaming others for faults. </br>

        <br>This is like the ancient custom:</br>
        <p class="iPara"> 

        <br>A person of virtue acts as if they were the debtor, demands nothing from others; </br>

        <br>And a person without virtue acts as if they were the creditor, demands only from others.</br> 

        <br>Through the debtor comes the fullness of life;</br>

        <br>Through the creditor comes only an empty hand.</br></p>

		<br>Imagine a nation with people. </br>

		<br>They have weapons, but there is no need for the use. </br>

		<br>People cherish their life and not pursue after fame and wealth; </br>

		<br>So that they have no intention to move to faraway places. </br>

		<br>Although there are boats and carriages, no one will ride them. </br>

		<br>Although there are weapons and armors, there is no occasion to display them.</br> 

		<br>Let the people return to the simple life where knotting ropes were used to record every event. </br>

		<br>People would then enjoy the simple food, simple clothing and be contented with a simple life. </br>

		<br>And they shall live happily with the traditional customs. </br>

		<br>Neighbors of the nations overlook one another in the near distance; </br>

		<br>The barks of dogs and crowing of cocks can be heard;</br>

		<br>But they leave each other in peace.</br>

		<br>People are so contented, they enjoy their life.</br>

		<br>Words of truth are not pleasing; </br>

		<br>Pleasing words are not truthful. </br>

		<br>The wise one does not argue; </br>

		<br>The one who argues is not wise.</br>

		<br>Those of virtue do not look for faults;</br>

		<br>Those who look for faults have no virtue. </br>

		<br>Masters do not possess and accumulate surplus for personal desire; </br>

		<br>The more they help others, the richer their life becomes; </br>

		<br>The more they give to others, the more they get in return. </br>

		<br>Nature benefits all and does not harm any; </br>

		<br>Acting for the good of all, is the way of the Master. </br>
